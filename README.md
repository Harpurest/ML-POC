1. We can run the file basic_model_preprocess_k_fold by importing it to the google colab or a Jupyter notebook.
2. For the last time I run the model. It reached the score
    auc:  0.8108670726141309
    f1 score:  0.7319587628865979
    accuracy:  0.74

In my opinion, this kind of model can work but the accuracy is not good enough. However, I believe with the process in the basic_model_preprocess_k_fold, we can test other models and find better solutions
